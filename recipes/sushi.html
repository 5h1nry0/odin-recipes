    <h1>Sushi</h1>
    <img src="img/sushi.jpg" alt="sushi" height="300" width="300"> 
    <p><strong>Sushi</strong> is a Japanese dish featuring specially prepared rice and usually some type of fish or seafood, often raw, but sometimes cooked.</p>
    <p>And though you might automatically associate the word sushi with raw fish, it's actually the rice that is the most important ingredient. 
    Indeed, the word "sushi" refers to the sour flavor of the vinegared rice. Regardless of the toppings or fillings, sushi always includes rice.</p>
    <p> As a matter of fact, sushi rice is so important that sushi chefs in Japan undergo years of training just to learn how to cook the rice properly, before they ever begin to handle any fish or seafood.</p> 
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 nori sheets</li>
            <li>100g skinless salmon fillet (use really fresh), thinly sliced lengthways</li>
            <li>¼ cucumber, deseeded, thinly sliced lengthways</li>
            <li>squeeze wasabi, plus extra to serve</li>
            <li>pickled sushi ginger, to serve</li>
            <li>light soy sauce, to serve</li>
            <li>salmon roe, to serve (optional)</li>
            <h4>For the rice</h4>
            <li>100g sushi rice</li>
            <li>2 tsp saké or mirin (optional)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp caster sugar (omit if using mirin)</li>
            <li>25ml rice vinegar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, make the rice. Rinse the sushi rice in a colander, massaging it with your hands until the water runs clear. Leave to drain for 15 mins.</li>
            <li>Put the rice in a saucepan with 200ml water and the sake or mirin, if using. Bring to the boil, then cover with a lid, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20 mins until the liquid is absorbed. Remove from the heat. Set aside, covered, for 15-20 mins.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a large bowl. Dissolve the sugar, if using, in the vinegar with a good pinch of salt, pour over the rice and mix. Cover with a damp tea towel and set aside at room temperature until ready to use.</li>
            <li>Put 1 nori sheet on a bamboo mat and cover the surface with half of the cooled rice. Lay half of the salmon and cucumber slices along the length of the rice in a strip, being careful not to overfill it. Run a pea-sized blob of wasabi (more if you like it really hot) along the edge of the filling with your finger.</li>
            <li>Roll up tightly and squeeze to seal when you reach the end. Repeat with the remaining nori, salmon and cucumber, and more wasabi. Slice each roll into 6 pieces, and serve with extra wasabi, ginger, soy sauce and salmon roe, if you like.<em> Will keep in the fridge for 1 day.</em> </li>
        </ol>
